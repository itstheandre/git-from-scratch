{{! How to create a new branch? -> git checkout -b <name-of-the-branch> }}

  {{!-- BASES:
  to push code online:
  git add .
  git commit -m "with a message"
  git push

  if youre working with more people, you should have branches
  how to create a branch:
  git checkout -b name-of-branch
  how to move between branches (that already exist)

  git checkout name-of-branch

  the first time you try to push ona new brach:
  if you do 
  git push -> ⛔️ its going to fail
  it will tell you that that branch doesnt exist on the "remote origin" yet. what this means, is that online that branch doesnt exist:
  solution:
  git push -u origin name-of-your-branch


  when you are ready to merge with your partner:
  git checkout (for example) dev
  git pull (just in case your partner wrote some code before)
  git merge name-of-your-branch (deal with any possible conflicts)

  git push

  git checkout back-to-your-branch
  git merge dev (for example)
